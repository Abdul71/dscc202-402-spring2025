Here is some helpful information about importing archives into the Databricks Environment: 
[Getting Started](https://docs.databricks.com/en/workspace/index.html)

Import the DBC archive from the Learning Spark v2 GitHub repository into your account. (this is the code that goes along with the test book)
[DBC Archive](https://github.com/databricks/LearningSparkV2/blob/master/notebooks/LearningSparkv2.dbc)

Import the DBC archives for the class after unzipping dscc202-402-dbc.zip on your machine.
- asp.dbc   apache spark programming
- de.dbc    data engineering with delta lake and spark
- ml.dbc    machine learning on spark

## Running your own local Spark Environment on your Computer [optional]
[Install docker on your computer](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

Pull the all-spark-notebook image from docker hub: <br>
<code>https://hub.docker.com/r/lpalum/dsc402</code>
<br>Launch the docker image to open a Jupyter Lab instance in your local browser:<br>
<code>docker run -it --rm -p 8888:8888 --name all-spark --volume /home/[your account name]/code/github:/home/jovyan/work lpalum/dsc402 start.sh Jupyter lab</code>

This will start a Jupyter lab instance on your machine that you will be able to access at port 8888 in your browser, and it will mount the GitHub repo that you previously
cloned into the container working directory.
